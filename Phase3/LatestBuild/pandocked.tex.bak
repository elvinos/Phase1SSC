\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This report analyses the effectiveness of a using a PID controller
derived in Phase 2. Before implementing the controller on the Quanser
rig, the controller was first tested by placing nonlinearities into the
simulation in the form of a rate limiter and saturation. Through
applying the design process the new control objectives were met which
could them be implemented on the Quanser rig and further refined to
create a controller which met requirements. The following report
discusses both the design process, results and any observations made
through creating an effective controller for the Quanser rig.

The following transfer function was used taken from phase 1:

\begin{align*}
&\text{$2^{nd}$ Order: }k \cdot \frac { 1.109\cdot \frac{180} {\pi} }{ s^2 + 0.1313s +1.109 }
&&\text{$1^{st}$ Order: }k \cdot \frac { 1 }{ 15.24s +1 }
\end{align*}

Where \(k = 0.26\).
