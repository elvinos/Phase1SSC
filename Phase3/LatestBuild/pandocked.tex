\section{Transfer Function
Definition}\label{transfer-function-definition}

Clearly give the transfer function, control architecture and steps of
the design process. Provide a table with the controller gains obtained
from the theoretical part, from the initial tuning in Simulink, and
those finally used in the Quanser. Show the closed-loop output responses
for the plant and controller. Overlay in a single plot the responses
from {[}2{]} and {[}3{]} (using the same step and the same initial
condition).
